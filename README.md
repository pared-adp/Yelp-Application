# Yelp-Application

This is a class project done by two other students that helped develop a simple Yelp database that queries results for users.
The interface can search for restaurants based on state, city, and zip code. The results are basic information about the establishments such as location, hours, and cuisine. 
The program allows users to select a successful, overpriced and popular restaurants.
